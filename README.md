## Features (Implementation Status)

### âœ… Task 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- [x] Chrome extension manifest with AI API permissions
- [x] TypeScript configuration and build system
- [x] Basic extension popup, background script, and content script
- [x] Message passing system between components

### ðŸš§ Upcoming Tasks

- [ ] Task 2.1: Content extraction engine
- [ ] Task 2.2: Screenshot capture system
- [ ] Task 2.3: Automatic content detection
- [ ] And many more...

## Architecture

The extension uses a modular architecture with:

- **Background Script**: Coordinates between components and handles extension lifecycle
- **Content Script**: Runs on web pages to capture content and detect user interactions
- **Popup Interface**: Quick access for search and capture actions
- **Side Panel**: Contextual content suggestions and chat interface
- **Message Passing**: Type-safe communication between all components

## Chrome AI APIs

The extension is designed to use Chrome's built-in AI APIs:

- Prompt API for concept extraction
- Summarizer API for content summaries
- Writer API for enhanced content generation
- Translator API for multilingual support

## Privacy

Synapse prioritizes privacy by:

- Processing content locally using Chrome's built-in AI APIs by default
- Storing data locally in IndexedDB
- Offering optional cloud features with explicit user consent
- Providing complete data export capabilities
